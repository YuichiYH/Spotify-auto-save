# Spotify-auto-save
An spotify automation to automatically save the Weekly Discovery Playlist.

## How to use it (WIP)
You must edit the config_toke.py file with your client id and secret
 - you can get those in the <a href="https://developer.spotify.com" target="_blank">Spotify developer website</a>

The Python file uses 3 arguments,
 - Your user ID
 - The playlist that you want to storage musics
 - The playlist that you want to copy

## To Do
 - automate the 3 arguments so no arguments need to be given, and they can be configurated
 - create a config file
 - Change redirect URL to an readme or another url
