# Spotify-auto-save
An spotify automation to automatically save the Weekly Discovery Playlist.

## How to use it (WIP)
The Python file uses 3 arguments,
 - Your user ID
 - The playlist that you want to storage musics
 - The playlist that you want to copy

## To Do
 - Added the actual add music to playlist
 - automate the 3 arguments so no arguments need to be given, and they can be configurated
 - create a config file
